 *                           COSMORE "GAME2" UNIT                            *
 *                                                                           *
 * This file is primarily a bag of utility functions used by GAME1. There is *
 * a lot of junk in this file -- variables and functions whose name includes *
 * the literal word "junk." These are maintained to keep the reconstruction  *
 * faithful to the original, but none of them serve any useful purpose and   *
 * they could be safely removed without impacting gameplay.                  *
 *                                                                           *
 * The first 17 functions in this file all pertain to music playback through *
 * an AdLib or compatible sound card. That code appears to have been copied  *
 * with slight modification from id Software's "Sound Manager" v1.1d1 by     *
 * Jason Blochowiak, as it existed around the development of Catacomb 3-D.   *
 * They are the only functions in the game that use inline assembly.         *
 *                                                                           *
 * Three of the joystick related functions also appear to have a connection  *
 * to id Software. These bear some similarity to functions in their "C       *
 * Library" by either John Romero or John Carmack, as released with          *
 * Hovertank 3-D.                                                            *

properties:
  - 1 byte of EGA memory == 8 horizontal screen pixels (disregarding planes)
  - 40 bytes of EGA memory == 320 horizontal screen pixels
  - Each screen tile is 8 vertical pixels high
  - Therefore, each tile Y coordinate step == 320 EGA memory bytes

given to it as relative to the start of the area of video memory which is used
to hold solid tiles, so it adds an offset of `EGA_OFFSET_SOLID_TILES` to it. But
CopyTilesToEGA() uses absolute addresses (i.e., relative to the start of video
