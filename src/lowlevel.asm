; This game uses EGA mode Dh's default palette with a few rare exceptions. This
; palette has several useful properties: Bits 0,1,2,3 in the palette index
; correspond directly to memory planes 0,1,2,3 and to bits 0,1,2,4 in the color
; value. When shown on screen, each bit, regardless of the context, affects the
; visible B,G,R,I channels in a predictable way. (See the documentation for
; the SetPaletteRegister procedure for an explanation of why the color value
; bits are not contiguous.)

; Load one video palette register with the specified color value.

; The color value is a byte with the highest two bits unused. The exact meaning

; connected to the adapter. IBM had three different display units that used
; similar 9-pin connectors:
; - IBM Monochrome Display
; - IBM Color Display
; - IBM Enhanced Color Display
;
; The three display types were electrically interchangeable, and the EGA
; hardware was capable of driving any of the three displays provided it was set
; to a video mode that was supported by that display. Since the signal at each
; pin could be either on or off (with no intermediate levels), the two signal
; pins on the Monochrome Display supported 4 different shades of mono, the four
; signal pins on the Color Display supported 16 colors, and the six signal pins
; on the Enhanced Color Display supported 64 colors. There is a direct mapping
; between the individual bits in a color value and the signals on the display
; connector pins, as shown on the abbreviated pinouts [ECD, pg. 6]:
;
;   Pin | Monochrome  | Color         | Enhanced Color  | Color Value Bit
;   ----+-------------+---------------+-----------------+----------------
;     5 | --          | Blue          | Blue            | 00.....X
;     4 | --          | Green         | Green           | 00....X.
;     3 | --          | Red           | Red             | 00...X..
;     7 | Mono Signal | -- (Reserved) | Blue Intensity  | 00..X...
;     6 | Intensity   | Intensity     | Green Intensity | 00.X....
;     2 | -- (Ground) | -- (Ground)   | Red Intensity   | 00X.....
;
; NOTE: The base Red/Green/Blue signals contribute 67% of the power of a color
; channel, and the corresponding Intensity signal(s) provide the remaining 33%.
; Some sources refer to the Intensity signals as "least significant" due to the
; amount of output they generate, but this is confusing from the perspective of
; color value bit packing and we will never say it that way here.
;
; The Enhanced Color Display supported two modes [ECD, pg. 3]:
; - Mode 1: 200 lines, 15.75 kHz HSync rate, positive VSync pulse
; - Mode 2: 350 lines, 21.8 kHz HSync rate, negative VSync pulse
;
; The display used the polarity of the Vertical Sync pulse to determine which
; mode to use. In display mode 2, all six color inputs contributed to the
; picture and 64 colors were available for use. In mode 1, the Red Intensity and
; Blue Intensity inputs to the display were ignored, and the Green Intensity
; signal was applied across all three color channels [ECD, pg. 4]. This limited
; the display to 16 colors using the same RGBI pinout the Color Display used.
; Mode 1 also emulated the Color Display's handling of the color brown: When
; RGBI 1100 was received, the display fudged *just* the Green Intensity bit on
; to avoid an unpleasant dark yellow [ECD, pg. 4].
;
; This game uses video mode Dh exclusively -- a 200-line mode -- so there is
; only one intensity bit that can visibly change the screen color and it is not
; contiguous with the R/G/B bits. The 64 color values are really 16 distinct
; display colors, each repeated four times. The effective bit positions are:
;   Bits     | Meaning
;   ---------+--------
;   .......X | Blue
;   ......X. | Green
;   .....X.. | Red
;   ....0... | Not Used
;   ...X.... | Intensity
;   000..... | Not Used
;
; A silver lining to this is that, with the default EGA palette loaded, the bits
; in a palette register index correspond to bits in the color value, which match
; the RGBI signals being shown on the display. This is what allows EGA memory
; planes 0123 to be thought of as BGRI instead. If the sequence were changed or
; custom-mixed colors were used, this reasonable mental model would fall apart.

; Draw a single 8x8 pixel sprite tile, with translucency, to the draw page.
;
; The translucency effect is created by turning the "intensity" bit on for every
; pixel covered by the sprite, while leaving uncovered pixels alone. Visually
; this causes dark colors to lighten, and light colors to stay the same. The
; other color planes do not change.
;
; NOTE: This color effect fundamentally changes the pixels, meaning that
; "magenta" areas become "bright magenta" and no longer match for palette
; animation purposes.
;
; The tile data contains five color planes -- mask, blue, green, red, and
; intensity -- with 1-bit color depth on each plane. This procedure only deals
; with mask, ignoring the content of the other four planes. Tile image data is
; stored byte-planar in MBGRI order. Transparent areas have their mask bits set
; to 1.
;
; The basic theory of operation is as follows. For each pixel row in the tile:
; 1. Read a mask byte from the source data. Each bit maps to one screen pixel.
; 2. Invert the mask data bits to match the EGA's expectations.
; 3. Load the mask data into the EGA bit mask register. For each 0 bit in the
;    bit mask register, the EGA will ignore the data sent by the processor in
;    subsequent memory write operations and instead use the contents of a latch.
; 4. Load the map mask register with the binary value 1000, indicating that we
;    only want the writes to apply to the intensity plane. All other color
;    planes will remain unaffected.
; 5. Read the EGA memory to freshen the content of the latches, then write
;    binary value 11111111 back to the EGA memory, invoking a refresh of every
;    pixel on the row. Pixels that belong to a transparent area will be masked
;    off by the bit mask register and will not change. Planes that are not
;    intensity (i.e. RGB) will be masked off by the map mask register and will
;    not change either. The net result is that the intensity bit will be turned
;    on for every pixel belonging to an opaque part of the tile, while
;    transparent areas retain their previous value.
; 6. Advance the read position by a 5-byte step, and advance the write position
;    by a 40-byte step, in preparation for the next pixel row.
;
; Intersting tidbit: The written value in step 5 could just as easily be changed
; to all zeros, in which case the intensity bit would be turned *off* for every
; opaque pixel, leading to a darkening of light areas. Try it someday; the
; effect is pleasant.

; Draw a single 8x8 pixel sprite tile to the draw page.
;
; This procedure draws tiles that are part of actors, decorations, the player,
; and other non-map sprites, with transparency. It is also responsible for
; drawing UI font characters.
;
; The tile data contains five color planes -- mask, blue, green, red, and

; byte-planar in MBGRI order. Transparent areas have their mask bits set to 1.
;
; NOTE: Transparent areas in the tile *must* have the bits for all other color
; planes set to 0.
;
; The basic theory of operation is as follows:
; 1. Read the first four rows of mask bits from the source tile data. This
;    starts at the 0th byte of the tile data and repeats at 5-byte intervals.
;    Store these rows in four byte-width registers. (Ideally all eight rows
;    would be read, but the 286 does not have enough registers to do this. Four
;    rows are all that can be stored.)
; 2. For each of the four color planes:
;    a: Set the EGA map mask register to only apply memory write operations to
;       the current color plane being operated on.
;    b: Set the EGA read map select register to only load data from the color
;       plane being operated on during memory read operations.
;    c: For each pixel row in the tile:
;       A: Read one byte (i.e. eight pixels, or one tile row) from the EGA
;          memory to capture what's been written onto the current color plane in
;          the draw page thus far.
;       B: AND this with the mask data for the row. The first four rows are in
;          registers from step 1, the remaining rows must be read from the tile
;          source. This turns off (zeros) the pixels that are covered by an
;          opaque area of the tile.
;       C: OR the result with the color data from the tile source. This data is
;          located at 5-byte intervals, starting at an offset between 1 and 4
;          depending on the current color plane being operated on.
;       D: Write the result back to the original location in the EGA memory.
;          This updates one row of pixels on the current color plane.

; Draw a single 8x8 pixel masked tile to the draw page.
;
; This procedure draws tiles that are part of the game map, with transparency.
;
; This works almost identically to DrawSpriteTile, so the comments here aren't
; anywhere near as thorough. Consult the other procedure for a more detailed
; description of what the code here is doing.
;
; These are the differences between this procedure and DrawSpriteTile:
; - The pointer passed in the `src` argument is subtracted by 16,000. This
;   unexpected and frankly dangerous behavior is due to the split between solid
;   and masked tiles in the map data. Very briefly, solid tiles are represented
;   in the map data by values 0..15,999, and masked tiles are represented by
;   values 16,000..55,960. The C code uses 16,000 as a split point to decide
;   which procedure should be used to draw each tile. Unfortunately, it passes
;   the raw map value in `src` without correcting for the masked tile offset.
;   The subtraction of 16,000 normalizes the value and allows all masked tile
;   memory to be read.
; - Before drawing begins, the EGA registers are reprogrammed to ensure that
;   data flows from the processor directly to the EGA memory during write
;   operations, without the internal latches interfering.
; - After drawing is done, the map mask is explicitly set to binary 1111, making
;   future EGA memory reads affect all four color planes in parallel.
; - Before returning, the EGA registers are once again reprogrammed to allow
;   the internal latches to influence the data written by the processor.
;
; src (far pointer): Memory address of the first byte of tile data to read
;     *plus* a constant offset of 16,000. In other words, if the intention is to
;     read the 0th byte in memory, src must be a pointer at offset 16,000.
; x (word): X-position on the screen, in tiles. (0..39, leftmost column is 0)
; y (word): Y-position on the screen, in tiles. (0..24, topmost row is 0)

; Draw a single 8x8 pixel sprite tile, flipped vertically, to the draw page.
;
; This procedure draws tiles upside-down, to represent actors that are being
; destroyed or new items that are spawning into existence. This is a vertical
; flip, *not* a 180-degree rotation.
;
; The tile data contains five color planes -- mask, blue, green, red, and
; intensity -- with 1-bit color depth on each plane. Tile image data is stored
; byte-planar in MBGRI order. Transparent areas have their mask bits set to 1.
;
; NOTE: Transparent areas in the tile *must* have the bits for all other color
; planes set to 0.
;
; The basic theory of operation is as follows. On each of the four color planes:
; 1. Set the EGA map mask register to only apply memory write operations to the
;    current color plane being operated on.
; 2. Set the EGA read map select register to only load data from the color plane
;    being operated on during memory read operations.
; 3. For each pixel row in the tile:
;    a: Decrement the write position by a 40-byte step, since the goal is to
;       draw the tile rows in reverse order.
;    b: Read one byte (i.e. eight pixels, or one tile row) from the EGA
;       memory to capture what's been written onto the current color plane in
;       the draw page thus far.
;    c: AND this with the mask data for the row. The first four rows are in
;       registers from step 1, the remaining rows must be read from the tile
;       source. This turns off (zeros) the pixels that are covered by an
;       opaque area of the tile.
;    d: OR the result with the color data from the tile source. This data is
;       located at 5-byte intervals, starting at an offset between 1 and 4
;       depending on the current color plane being operated on.
;    e: Write the result back to the original location in the EGA memory.

; Draw a single 8x8 pixel sprite tile, as a white shape, to the draw page.
;
; This procedure draws tiles as solid white shapes, to represent actors that are
; taking damage or to get the player's attention.
;
; NOTE: This assumes port 3C4h has been set to 2h (sequencer index = map mask).
; This is the only state that the game ever leaves the register in, but it's an
; unsafe assumption.
;
; The basic theory of operation is as follows.
; 1. Program the EGA registers to accept the upcoming drawing technique. This
;    procedure uses an approach not seen in any other area of the game, so the
;    setup is a little unfamiliar in some places:
;    a. Set the Map Mask register to all 1's. This sets it so that any bits that
;       the processor sets to 1 will apply to all four color planes (red + green
;       + blue + intensity), resulting in white.
;    b. Set the Function Select value to OR any data written by the processor
;       against the EGA latches. This allows the processor to write 1 bits and
;       set the color to white, and write 0 bits to retain the current color,
;       whatever it might be.
;    c. Set the Read Mode value to combine the value of all four color planes
;       during memory reads. Considering the value already in the Color Don't
;       Care register (set in the SetVideoMode procedure), this is a rather
;       convoluted way to ensure the EGA returns FFh for all memory reads.
; 2. For each pixel row in the tile:
;    a. Read one byte (i.e. eight pixels, or one tile row) from the source
;       tile's mask data.
;    b. Invert the bits of the mask data, so each uncovered pixel has a 0 bit
;       while covered/opaque areas are 1 bits.
;    c. AND this value with the contents of the EGA memory. This causes a memory
;       read which sets the EGA's internal latches and returns FFh. (See step
;       1c for the cause of this behavior.) AND against FFh doesn't have any
;       interesting effects, so the result is the mask data being written
;       directly into memory. Written 1 bits become white, and 0 bits retain the
;       latched value and, consequently, the previous color.
;    d. Advance the read position by a 5-byte step, and advance the write
;       position by a 40-byte step, in preparation for the next pixel row.
; 3. Reset the Function Select and Read Mode values to their natural state.
;
; The tile data contains five color planes -- mask, blue, green, red, and
; intensity -- with 1-bit color depth on each plane. Tile image data is stored
; byte-planar in MBGRI order. Transparent areas have their mask bits set to 1.

; There are many similar but subtly different techniques for CPU detection out
; there. It would be a significant undertaking to try to trace the authorship
; of any specific test or group of tests. I'll briefly list some of the names
; and publications I was able to find:
; - Various code examples from Intel processor manuals.
; - Bob Smith with input from Arthur Zachai, in an article in PC Tech Journal,
;   Volume 4 Number 4, April 1986.
; - Robert de Bath, in a utility script provided with the Dev86 project
;   (https://github.com/jbruchon/dev86/blob/master/libc/misc/cputype.c).
; - Unknown author, in an assembly code fragment titled "Chips", where another
;   author named Clif Purkiser is mentioned as creating some techniques.
; - Juan Jimenez, mentioned in passing in files JABHACK.ASM and WL_ASM.ASM from
;   both the Wolfenstein 3D and Catacomb 3-D source releases. Modified, in all
;   likelihood, by Jason Blochowiak.
;
; This code, however, directly matches the structure and implementation choices
; used in "PROCCA.ASM" from a book titled "PC System Programming for Developers"
; by Michael Tischer, pages 664..666. Regardless of who discovered each test,
; this implementation was taken directly from Tischer's book.
;
; The following tests are performed:
; 1. Try to modify certain bits in the FLAGS register to determine if the CPU
;    is an 80286 or higher.
; 2. If step 1 succeeded, continue modifying bits in the FLAGS register to
;    differentiate between the 80286 and the 80386.
; 3. Otherwise, test an unreasonable right-shift instruction to see if it's
;    handled in the way an 80186/88 would.
; 4. Otherwise, test the behavior of a long-running instruction with multiple
;    prefixes to see if it handles interrupts properly like an NEC V30/20.
; 5. Finally, assume 8086/88.
; 6. Test the interplay between the processor's prefetch queue and self-
;    modifying code, to try to determine if the processor has an 8- or 16-bit
;    data bus.
