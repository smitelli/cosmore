Map tile values. Values 0..15,999 are spaced in increments of 8 and reference
solid tiles. Tiles not mentioned directly in the game code are excluded. For
tiles that are meant to appear as part of a map, the name offers some hint about
how their tile attributes make them behave:
- Empty/Free: Tile does not impede player/actor movement in any way. It is
  essentially background decoration.
- Platform: Tile blocks southern movement, but all other directions are free.
  These tiles behave like conventional platforms.
- Block: Tile prevents all movement and, in some instances, can be clung to.
